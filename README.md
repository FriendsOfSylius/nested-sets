Nested Set Assignment
=====================

Originally created for the Sylius Archetype component, this project will
created a nested set for all archetypes, to allow the hierarchy to be
queried more efficiently.

Also works with any Sylius Resource that has a `parent_id` field in the
database.

Things to do:
-------------

  * Create classes that allow the preordered tree traversal to be persisted
    on the resources in the database.
